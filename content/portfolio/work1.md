I wrote software to randomly generate trees of mathematical functions.  Once the tree is created, it is used to generate a GLSL pixel shader.  The shader is then templated into simple page and given to the user.

I created this for kicks as a throwback to a project I had in college.  It was pretty simple to make and created a lot of nice results.  I had a few other implementations (one in Python) that would generate frames which I would seam together using avconv.
