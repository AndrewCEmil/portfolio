Ripline
<!--more-->

My first real VR game.  I spent a long time on this one.  From gameplay to design, I definitely put a lot more effort into Ripline than any other game I have made thus far.  I did the entire thing in Unity with the GVR sdk for Daydream.

While I am happy and proud of what I made, its painful to look at how much time I spent on something and still see how flawed it is.  If nothing else, I am very happy with how comfortable I feel in Unity at this point.
