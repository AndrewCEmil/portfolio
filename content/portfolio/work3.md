Shaders.
<!--more-->

(Source)[https://github.com/AndrewCEmil/prettyshaders]

A set of pixel shaders that I made for fun.  All of them are hand-written GLSL.

I learned about pixel shaders from the fantastic site (pixelshaders.com)[http://pixelshaders.com/] by Toby Schachman.  Toby's Quazi-Crystal shader is one of my favorite pieces of digital art and I am a huge fan of his site/book.
