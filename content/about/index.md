+++

I am a person living in New York City.  Currently I lead the sync team at [Docurated](https://docurated.com).  In my spare time I try to make artsy or creative coding projects.  In the middle of 2016 I started to create virtual reality games.  I wish I could be more devoted or focused on outside-of-work-work, but I am proud of what I have accomplished.  My dream right now is to make a game that a lot of people enjoy and spend time exploring.

Outside of programming, I enjoy reading and playing pool.  At this point in my life I go to the gym pretty regularly, though I would not label myself as a health nut.  In terms of music I mostly listen to Metal, Emo, and Rap.  I also like to following the rapidly expanding "creative coding" field.  There are some really amazing artists making a name for themselves and I can't wait to see what people continue to come up with.
